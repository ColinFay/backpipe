Description: Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or 
    'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows for a performing operations from right-to-left. 
    This indispensible for writing clear code where there is natural 
    right-to-left ordering common with nested structures 
    and hierachies such as trees/directories or markup languages such as HTML 
    and XML.
