Description: Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or 
    'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows for a performing operations from right-to-left. 
    This allows writing more legible, interpretable and debugable code where 
    there is natural right-to-left ordering. This is common with nested 
    structures and hierarchies such as trees, directories or markup languages 
    such as HTML and XML. The package also includes a Rstudio IDE Add-in that 
    can be bound to a keyboard shortcut.
