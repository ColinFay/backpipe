Description: Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or 
    'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows for a performing operations from right-to-left.

    right-to-left ordering common with nested structures 
    and hierarchies such as trees/directories or markup languages such as HTML 
    and XML.
